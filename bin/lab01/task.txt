Open up Eclipse.
Make a new java hello world program.
Now we're going to play with arrays.
First, make a 1 dimensional array.
Fill it up via definition (int []arr = {3,4,2};)
Print it out.
Now, make a 1 dimensional array with 10 items.
Fill it up with a for loop.
Can you do the first 10 odd numbers?
Print it out.
Now try a 2D array of integers. Let's make it 2x100;
Fill it up with a loop.
Put the init in a function, and call it from the main.
Make a print function too, and call it.
Make a function that sorts based on the first number.
Print the result.
Make a function that sorts based on the second number.
Print it.
